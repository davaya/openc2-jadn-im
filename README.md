## Description

Information models (IMs) are used to define and generate physical data models, validate information instances, and enable lossless translation across data formats. JSON Abstract Data Notation (JADN) is a UML-based information modeling language that defines data structure independently of data format. This Committee Note describes the use of IMs, explains how to construct IMs using JADN, and contrasts IMs with other modeling approaches, such as Entity-Relationship models for databases, and knowledge models / ontologies.
